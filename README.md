# Employee-Management-System

A robust platform for managing employee records with role-based access and secure authentication.

# Overview
Our Employee Management System is a robust platform featuring role-based access and a seamless user experience for both Admin and Employee roles. Users can log in using their company email or employment code and password, with backend API verification directing them to their respective dashboards.

Admin users have comprehensive privileges, including creating, updating, and deleting employee records. Their dashboard provides a complete employee list with essential details and actions for managing records. Employee profiles are divided into Personal, Professional, Project, and Finance sections, each with specific validation rules.

Personal details capture vital information like name, contact, and emergency contacts, while Professional details focus on employment history and office-related data. Project details include current and previous projects, ensuring complete visibility into an employee's project involvement. The Finance section records financial information and offers employees access to downloadable payslips.

Employee dashboards are view-only, ensuring data integrity by allowing employees to see their details without edit permissions. The system emphasizes security, data accuracy, and user-friendly navigation, making it an essential tool for efficient employee management.
